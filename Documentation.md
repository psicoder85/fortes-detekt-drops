- Steps:
  - Configure a logging mechanism to capture all activities.
  - Ensure logs are stored securely and accessible only to authorized personnel.

7. **Multi-platform Support**
**Linux and macOS Support:**

- Library: `os`, `subprocess`
- Steps:
  - Modify the file monitoring module to support Linux and macOS.
  - Test the system on different operating systems to ensure compatibility.

8. **Performance Optimization**
**Optimization Techniques:**

- Steps:
  - Profile the code to identify performance bottlenecks.
  - Optimize data structures and algorithms for better performance.
  - Use multi-threading or asynchronous processing to handle large-scale environments.


## Example: Integrating Email Alerts
**Email Alert Implementation:**

1. Install Required Libraries:
   ```bash
       pip install smtplib

2. Add Email Alert Function:
`src/alerting.py`

   ```python
    import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart

def send_email_alert(subject, body, to_email):
    from_email = "your_email@example.com"
    from_password = "your_email_password"
    
    msg = MIMEMultipart()
    msg['From'] = from_email
    msg['To'] = to_email
    msg['Subject'] = subject
    
    msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))
    
    try:
        server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.example.com', 587)
        server.starttls()
        server.login(from_email, from_password)
        text = msg.as_string()
        server.sendmail(from_email, to_email, text)
        server.quit()
        print("Email alert sent successfully")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to send email alert: {e}")
 ```
3. Integrate Email Alerts into Detection Module:

`src/real_time_detection.py`
   ```python
      from alerting import send_email_alert

def monitor_file_system(path):
    model = joblib.load('../models/trained_model.pkl')
    while True:
        # Monitor file system activities
        time.sleep(1)
        # Detect ransomware
        if detect_ransomware(model, file_activity):
            print("Ransomware detected!")
            generate_report(file_activity)
            send_email_alert(
                "Ransomware Detected",
                f"Ransomware activity detected in file: {file_activity}",
                "recipient@example.com"
            )
  ```
