# Security Compliance Standards

## Overview
This section outlines the adherence to security compliance standards in the development and implementation of the Ransomware Detector and Analysis Tool. The tool aligns with two major standards: ISO 27001 and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. These standards help ensure that the tool is developed with a strong security posture, focusing on protecting sensitive information and managing risks effectively.

## ISO 27001 Compliance

### Overview of ISO 27001
ISO/IEC 27001 is an international standard for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS). It provides a systematic approach to managing sensitive company information, ensuring its confidentiality, integrity, and availability through a set of security controls.

### Compliance in the Project
1. **Information Security Policy:**

 - Documentation: The project has documented policies governing information security practices. These policies are reflected in the README.md file and technical documentation.
 - Implementation: Secure coding practices are followed, and sensitive information, such as passwords and API keys, is managed securely.

2. **Risk Management:**

 - Risk Assessment: A risk assessment is conducted to identify potential threats, including ransomware attacks, and their impact.
 - Risk Treatment: Mitigation strategies are implemented, such as encryption, real-time detection, and quarantine mechanisms.

3. **Asset Management:**

 - Asset Inventory: The project maintains an inventory of all assets, including code, models, and data.
 - Access Control: Access to sensitive parts of the system, including data and model files, is restricted to authorized personnel.

4. **Access Control:**

 - User Management: Access to the tool is managed through authentication and authorization mechanisms.
 - Least Privilege: Users are granted the minimum level of access necessary for their role.

5. **Cryptographic Controls:**

 - Encryption: The tool uses encryption to secure sensitive data, both in transit and at rest. The cryptography library is used for this purpose.

6. **Incident Management:**

 - Incident Response: Procedures are in place for responding to security incidents, including ransomware detection and alerting mechanisms.

7. **Compliance Monitoring:**

 - Audit Logs: Detailed logs are maintained for auditing and monitoring purposes. The logs include information on file activities and detected threats.

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework Compliance

### Overview of NIST Cybersecurity Framework
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) provides a policy framework of computer security guidance for how private sector organizations can assess and improve their ability to prevent, detect, and respond to cybersecurity incidents.

### Compliance in the Project

1. **Identify:**

 - Asset Management: The tool maintains an inventory of assets and categorizes them based on their importance and sensitivity.
 - Risk Management: Risks associated with ransomware and other threats are identified and assessed.

2. **Protect:**

 - Access Control: Authentication and authorization controls are implemented to protect access to the tool and its components.
 - Data Security: Encryption and secure storage practices protect sensitive data.
 - Awareness and Training: Documentation and training materials are provided to ensure that users are aware of security best practices.

3. **Detect:**

 - Anomalies and Events: Real-time monitoring is implemented to detect unusual file system activities indicative of ransomware.
 - Continuous Monitoring: Ongoing monitoring of system activities ensures timely detection of potential threats.

4. **Respond:**

 -Response Planning: Incident response plans are in place for addressing ransomware detections and other security incidents.
 - Communication: Alerts and notifications are sent to relevant stakeholders when ransomware is detected.

5. **Recover:**

 - Recovery Planning: Procedures are established for recovering from ransomware attacks, including quarantining affected files and restoring from backups.
 - Improvements: Lessons learned from incidents are used to improve the system and prevent future occurrences.
 
## Implementation and Best Practices

### Encryption and Secure Coding
 -Library Usage: cryptography library is used for encrypting sensitive data.
 - Code Reviews: Regular code reviews are conducted to ensure adherence to secure coding practices.

### Logging and Monitoring
 - Audit Trails: Comprehensive logging is implemented for all critical operations.
 - Real-Time Monitoring: The tool includes real-time monitoring features to detect suspicious activities.

### Incident Response
- Alerting: Automated alerts are configured to notify administrators of detected ransomware.
 - Incident Handling: Clear procedures are in place for managing and responding to security incidents.

### Access Control
 - Role-Based Access: Users are assigned roles with specific permissions based on their responsibilities.
 - Authentication: Strong authentication mechanisms are used to protect access to the tool.
